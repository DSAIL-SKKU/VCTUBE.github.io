            <em>Data collection: </em> We collected post data from the following six mental-health-related subreddits, each of which is reported to be associated witha specific disorder: r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/bipolar, r/BPD, r/schizophrenia, and r/autism.
            In addition, we further collected post data from the most popular health-related subreddit, r/mentalhealth, to analyze posts with general health information.
            <br><br>
            <em>Data anonymization: </em> All the user information is anonymized, hence no personally identifiable information was not identified; we followed all the anonymization process guided by the Sungkyunkwan University Institutional Review Board (IRB).

            <em>Classification models: </em> We developed six binary classification models, each of which categorizes a user' specific post into one of the following subreddits: r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/bipolar, r/BPD, r/schizophrenia, and r/autism.
            Our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deals with the problem.
            Therefore, we developed six independent binary classification models for each symptom to improve the performance.
            By developing six independent models for each mental disorder, each of which uses data where users suffer from only one particular mental problem, we were able to accurately identify a user's potential mental state.
            <br><br>
            We divided our dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. We used two well-known classifiers, XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
            Note that we excluded the posts of users who wrote posts across multiple subreddits in learning phase.
